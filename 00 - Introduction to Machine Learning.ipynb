Rather than programmers crafting data-processing\n","rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?\n","\n","- This question opens the door to a new programming paradigm. In classical programming,\n","the paradigm of symbolic AI, humans input rules (a program) and data to\n","be processed according to these rules, and out come answers (see figure 1.2). With\n","machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data,\n","and out come the rules. These rules can then be applied to new data to produce original\n","answers.\n","\n","![image.png](https://oi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/programming_paradigm.png)\n","\n","- A machine-learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed\n","\n","- Although machine learning only started to flourish in the 1990s, it has quickly\n","become the most popular and most successful subfield of AI, a trend driven by the\n","availability of faster hardware and larger datasets\n","\n","- As a\n","result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits comparatively little\n","mathematical theory—maybe too little—and is engineering oriented. It’s a hands-on\n","discipline in which ideas are proven empirically more often than theoretically.\n","\n","### Learnign Representation Data\n","\n","So, to do machine learning, we need three things:\n","\n","- Input data poitns: If the task is image tagging,\n","they could be pictures.\n","\n","- Examples of expected output: In an image task, expected outputs\n","could be tags such as “dog,” “cat,” and so on.\n","\n","- A way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job: The measurement is used as a feedback signal to adjust\n","the way the algorithm works\n","\n","Therefore,the central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully\n","transform data: in other words, to learn useful representations of the input data at\n","hand—representations that get us closer to the expected output.\n","\n","Machine-learning models are all about finding appropriate representations for their input data—transformations of the data that make it more amenable to the task at hand, such as a classification task.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S_5CU7cIucrw"},"source":["### Example of Machine
